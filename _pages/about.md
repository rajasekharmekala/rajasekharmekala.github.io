I am a Software Developer at Adobe, currently working on Adobe Journey Optimizer. I recently graduated from the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), where I focused on NLP applications in software, particularly in the field of explainability for large language models. Prior to this, I completed my B.Tech at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/), with a major in Electrical Engineering and a minor in Computer Science.

In terms of my professional experience, I've had the opportunity to work as a full-time employee and previously interned at [TruckX](https://truckx.com/). Before that, I worked as a software developer at Adobe's [Techcomm](https://www.adobe.com/products/technicalcommunicationsuite.html) division from 2018 to 2021. Additionally, I had the privilege of interning at Adobe Research's [BigData Experience Lab](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/) in 2017.

I am an avid sports enthusiast, with a particular passion for badminton. Alongside my athletic interests, I am also highly interested in studying the Indian stock market and have a constant desire to stay informed and up-to-date. As a curious individual, I am driven to connect various hypotheses and test them in practice. Generally, It deepens my understanding of this world in general and drives the pursuit of new knowledge and experiences.
