Iâ€™m currently a 2nd-year masters student at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/), focusing on NLP applications in software, specifically explainability of large language models. I completed my B.Tech at [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. I have recently interned at [TruckX](https://truckx.com/)(2022) and [SiteRecon](https://www.siterecon.ai/). Previously, I worked as a software developer at Adobe's [Techcomm](https://www.adobe.com/products/technicalcommunicationsuite.html) (2018-2021) and did an internship at [BigData Experience Lab](https://research.adobe.com/careers/bangalore/)(2017), Adobe Research.  

I am an avid sports enthusiast, with a particular passion for badminton. Alongside my athletic interests, I am also highly interested in studying the Indian stock market and have a constant desire to stay informed and up-to-date. As a curious individual, I am driven to connect various hypotheses and test them in practice. Generally, It deepens my understanding of this world in general and drives the pursuit of new knowledge and experiences.
